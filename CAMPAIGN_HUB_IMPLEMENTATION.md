## ðŸ“‹ Integration Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Update your database with the new schema
npm run db:migrate
```

### Step 2: Update Navigation
Add "Campaigns" to the main dashboard navigation:

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/components/DashboardNavbar.tsx`

Add this navigation item:
```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => setActiveSection('campaigns')}
  className={`flex items-center space-x-3 px-4 py-3 rounded-lg transition-all ${
    activeSection === 'campaigns'
      ? 'bg-indigo-600 text-white'
      : 'text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-100'
  }`}
>
  <i className="ri-flag-line text-xl"></i>
  <span>Campaigns</span>
</button>
```

And add the route handler:
```tsx
case 'campaigns':
  router.push('/campaigns/role-selection');
  break;
```

### Step 3: Build Remaining UI Components
Follow the structure above to create each remaining page. Use these patterns:

**Fetching Campaigns (Employer)**:
```tsx
const response = await fetch('/api/campaigns?role=employer');
const { campaigns } = await response.json();
```

**Fetching Campaigns (Worker)**:
```tsx
const response = await fetch('/api/campaigns?role=worker');
const { campaigns } = await response.json();
```

**Creating a Campaign**:
```tsx
const response = await fetch('/api/campaigns', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Q4 Social Media Blast',
    description: 'Help us with social media content',
    type: 'ongoing',
    category: 'Social Media',
    required_skills: ['#social-media', '#content-creation'],
    target_workers: 50,
    base_payment: 10.00,
    currency: 'USD',
    visibility: 'public',
    group_chat_enabled: true,
    initial_deposit: 500.00
  })
});
```

**Joining a Campaign**:
```tsx
const response = await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${campaignId}/members`, {
  method: 'POST'
});
```

**Sending a Bonus Payment**:
```tsx
const response = await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${campaignId}/bonus-payment`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    worker_id: 'user-uuid-here',
    amount: 5.00,
    note: 'Excellent work on the last submission!'
  })
});
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Guidelines

### Color Scheme
- **Employer**: Indigo (`indigo-600`, `indigo-700`)
- **Worker**: Purple (`purple-600`, `purple-700`)
- **Success**: Green (`green-500`, `green-600`)
- **Warning**: Yellow/Orange (`yellow-500`, `orange-500`)
- **Danger**: Red (`red-500`, `red-600`)

### Icons (Remix Icon)
- Campaign: `ri-flag-line`
- Employer: `ri-briefcase-line`
- Worker: `ri-tools-line`
- Chat: `ri-message-3-line`
- Payment: `ri-money-dollar-circle-line`
- Submit: `ri-upload-line`
- Members: `ri-team-line`

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: Default (< 640px)
- Tablet: `sm:` (â‰¥ 640px)
- Desktop: `lg:` (â‰¥ 1024px)

## ðŸ”” Notifications System

The notification system hooks are already in place through the API. When implementing the UI notification component, listen for these events:

1. **Campaign Join**: When a worker joins a campaign
2. **New Message**: When a new chat message is posted
3. **Submission Review**: When employer reviews a submission
4. **Bonus Payment**: When employer sends a bonus payment
5. **Campaign Status Change**: When campaign is paused/completed/cancelled

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist
