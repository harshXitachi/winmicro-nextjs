# ✅ USDT Deposit Issue - FIXED

## Problem
Error: "Failed to create deposit transaction"

## Root Cause
The database `where` clause was using incorrect syntax and missing the `eq` import from drizzle-orm.

## Solution Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed Import Statement
Added missing `eq` import:
```typescript
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed Database Queries
Changed from:
```typescript
.where({ id: transaction.id })
```

To:
```typescript
.where(eq(wallet_transactions.id, transaction.id))
```

### 3. ✅ Verified CoinPayments API
- API connection: ✅ Working
- Account: sandeep29x@proton.me
- Merchant ID: 31597965f1d8ecb75aaf9f256d09075c
