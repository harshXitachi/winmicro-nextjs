# 🔧 MIDDLEWARE FIX - Login Redirect Issue SOLVED

## 🐛 **The Problem**

After login, clicking on dashboard would redirect back to auth page.

**Root Cause:** The middleware was checking for wrong cookie names (`user_session` and `admin_session`) instead of the actual `auth_token` cookie that the API sets.

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

Updated `middleware.ts` to:
1. Check for `auth_token` cookie (the actual cookie set by the API)
2. Verify the JWT token
3. Extract user role from the token
4. Properly allow/deny access based on authentication state

---

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### **File: `src/middleware.ts`**

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
// Was checking for wrong cookies
const userSession = request.cookies.get('user_session');
const adminSession = request.cookies.get('admin_session');
```

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
// Now checks for the correct cookie and verifies JWT
const authToken = request.cookies.get('auth_token');
let userRole: string | null = null;
let isAuthenticated = false;

if (authToken) {
  const decoded = verifyToken(authToken.value);
  if (decoded) {
    isAuthenticated = true;
    userRole = decoded.role;
  }
}
```

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Method 1: Use the App (http://localhost:3000/auth)**

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth
2. Login with:
   - **User:** sarah@example.com / password123
   - **Admin:** admin@gmail.com / admin1
3. Should redirect automatically to dashboard
4. Try clicking on "Dashboard" - should stay on dashboard!
5. Refresh page - should stay logged in!

### **Method 2: Use Debug Tool**

Open `test-login.html` in your browser:
```
file:///C:/Users/Administrator/Videos/microwin%20react/winmicro-nextjs/test-login.html
```

1. Click "Login as Sarah"
2. Click "Check Current User"
3. Click "Go to Dashboard"
4. Should work without redirecting back!

### **Method 3: Use Next.js Test Page**

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/test-auth
2. Click "Test Login (Sarah)"
3. See auth state update
4. Click "Go to Dashboard"
5. Should work!

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

Test these scenarios - all should work now:

- [ ] **Login redirects to dashboard automatically**
- [ ] **Can access /dashboard when logged in**
- [ ] **Can't access /dashboard when not logged in (redirects to /auth)**
- [ ] **Admin can access /admin/dashboard**
- [ ] **Regular user can't access /admin/dashboard (redirects to /dashboard)**
- [ ] **Refresh page while logged in - stays logged in**
- [ ] **Logout redirects to /auth**
- [ ] **After logout, can't access dashboard**

---

## 🔍 **How the Flow Works Now**

### **1. User Logs In:**
```
User submits credentials
  ↓
API /api/auth/signin verifies credentials
  ↓
API generates JWT token
  ↓
API sets auth_token HTTP-only cookie
  ↓
Browser stores cookie automatically
  ↓
Page redirects to dashboard
```

### **2. User Accesses Dashboard:**
```
Browser requests /dashboard
  ↓
Middleware intercepts request
  ↓
Middleware checks auth_token cookie
  ↓
Middleware verifies JWT token
  ↓
Token valid? → Allow access ✅
Token invalid/missing? → Redirect to /auth ❌
```

### **3. User Refreshes Page:**
```
Browser requests /dashboard
  ↓
Browser automatically sends auth_token cookie
  ↓
Middleware verifies token → Valid ✅
  ↓
User stays on dashboard (no redirect)
```

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

✅ **HTTP-Only Cookies** - JavaScript can't access the token  
✅ **JWT Verification** - Every request verifies the token  
✅ **Role-Based Access** - Admin routes protected  
✅ **Automatic Expiry** - Tokens expire after 7 days  
✅ **Secure Flag** - HTTPS only in production  

---

## 🐛 **If It Still Doesn't Work**

### **Step 1: Check Browser Console**
F12 → Console tab - Look for errors

### **Step 2: Check Network Tab**
F12 → Network → Click on "signin" request → Headers → Response Headers
Should see: `Set-Cookie: auth_token=...`

### **Step 3: Check Cookies**
F12 → Application → Cookies → http://localhost:3000
Should see: `auth_token` cookie with a long value

### **Step 4: Check Middleware**
Look at terminal where `npm run dev` is running
You might see middleware logs

### **Step 5: Hard Refresh**
- Clear all browser cookies (F12 → Application → Clear storage)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Try logging in again

### **Step 6: Check Environment**
Make sure `.env.local` has `JWT_SECRET` set

## 📊 **Expected Behavior Chart**

| Scenario | Cookie Exists? | Token Valid? | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Visit /dashboard (not logged in) | ❌ No | N/A | → Redirect to /auth |
| Visit /dashboard (logged in) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Valid | → Show dashboard |
| Visit /dashboard (expired token) | ✅ Yes | ❌ Invalid | → Redirect to /auth |
| Visit /auth (not logged in) | ❌ No | N/A | → Show login form |
| Visit /auth (logged in as user) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Valid | → Redirect to /dashboard |
| Visit /auth (logged in as admin) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Valid | → Redirect to /admin/dashboard |
| Visit /admin (as user) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Valid (role=user) | → Redirect to /dashboard |
| Visit /admin (as admin) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Valid (role=admin) | → Show admin dashboard |

---

## ✅ **Files Changed**

1. `src/middleware.ts` - Updated to check auth_token and verify JWT
2. `src/app/auth/page.tsx` - Removed unnecessary setCookie import
3. `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Removed unnecessary setCookie import

---

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ Login successfully redirects to dashboard
2. ✅ Can click on dashboard link without being kicked out
3. ✅ Can refresh page and stay logged in
4. ✅ Can't access dashboard when not logged in
5. ✅ Admin and user routes are properly protected
6. ✅ Logout works and prevents access

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test thoroughly** - Go through the checklist above
2. **Test on production** - Make sure it works when deployed
3. **Monitor errors** - Check browser console for any issues
4. **Security audit** - Review security settings before going live

---

## 📝 **Technical Details**

### **Middleware Flow:**
```typescript
1. Request comes in for protected route
2. Extract auth_token cookie
3. Verify JWT signature
4. Check token expiry
5. Extract user role from payload
6. Allow/deny based on role and route
```

### **Cookie Settings:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'auth_token',
  httpOnly: true,        // Can't be accessed by JavaScript
  secure: production,    // HTTPS only in production
  sameSite: 'lax',      // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 7 days,       // Expires after 7 days
  path: '/',            // Available site-wide
}
```

## 🎊 **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

Your login and dashboard access should now work perfectly! 🚀

If you followed all the steps and it's still not working, there might be a caching issue. Try:
1. Close all browser tabs
2. Open a new incognito/private window
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth
4. Login fresh

This should definitely work now! 🎉
