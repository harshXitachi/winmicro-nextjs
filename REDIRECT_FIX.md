# 🔧 Login Redirect Fix

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Missing `credentials: 'include'` in API calls**
- **Problem:** Cookies weren't being sent/received because fetch requests didn't include credentials
- **Solution:** Added `credentials: 'include'` to all auth API calls (signup, signin, signout)

### **2. Incomplete user object structure**
- **Problem:** User object didn't have `user_metadata` field that dashboard expects
- **Solution:** Updated all auth endpoints to return properly structured user object with `user_metadata`

### **3. Redirect timing issues**
- **Problem:** Page was trying to redirect before cookie was set
- **Solution:** Used `window.location.replace()` with timeout for cleaner redirect

## 🧪 **Test Your Login**

### **Option 1: Regular Login Page**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth
2. Login with credentials:
   - **User:** sarah@example.com / password123
   - **Admin:** admin@gmail.com / admin1
3. Should redirect to dashboard automatically

### **Option 2: Test Auth Page (Debug)**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/test-auth
2. Click "Test Login (Sarah)" button
3. Check auth state displayed on page
4. Click "Check Cookies" to see cookies in console
5. Click "Go to Dashboard" to test redirect

## 🔍 **How to Debug Login Issues**

### **Check Browser Console:**
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab, you should see:
```
🔐 Starting login process
✅ Login successful, user data: { id: "...", email: "...", role: "..." }
📧 User role: user
🚀 Redirecting now...
🎯 Target URL: /dashboard
```

### **Check Network Tab:**
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. Try to login
3. Find the `signin` request
4. Click on it → Headers → Response Headers
5. Should see: `Set-Cookie: auth_token=...`

### **Check Cookies:**
1. DevTools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies
2. Look for `http://localhost:3000`
3. Should see: `auth_token` cookie

### **Check API Response:**
In Network tab, click on `signin` request → Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "email": "sarah@example.com",
    "role": "user",
    "user_metadata": {
      "first_name": "Sarah",
      "last_name": "Johnson",
      "role": "user"
    }
  },
  "profile": { ... }
}
```

## 🛠️ **What Was Changed**

### **Files Modified:**

#### **1. `src/lib/api-client.ts`**
```typescript
// Added credentials: 'include' to all auth functions
export const signIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/auth/signin`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    credentials: 'include', // ← Added this
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),
  });
  // ...
};
```

#### **2. `src/app/api/auth/signin/route.ts`**
```typescript
// Added user_metadata to response
const response = NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.role,
    user_metadata: { // ← Added this
      first_name: user.first_name,
      last_name: user.last_name,
      role: user.role,
    },
  },
  profile: userProfile || null,
});
```

#### **3. `src/app/auth/page.tsx`**
```typescript
// Improved redirect logic
if (data?.user) {
  console.log('✅ Login successful');
  setTimeout(() => {
    const targetUrl = data.user.role === 'admin' ? '/admin/dashboard' : '/dashboard';
    window.location.replace(targetUrl); // ← Changed to .replace()
  }, 500);
}
```

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

Test these scenarios:

- [ ] Can login as regular user (sarah@example.com)
- [ ] Redirects to `/dashboard` after regular user login
- [ ] Can login as admin (admin@gmail.com)
- [ ] Redirects to `/admin/dashboard` after admin login
- [ ] Cookie is set in browser (check DevTools → Application → Cookies)
- [ ] Can access dashboard without re-login after page refresh
- [ ] Logout works and redirects to `/auth`
- [ ] Can't access `/dashboard` when logged out (redirects to auth)

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: Still can't login**
**Solutions:**
1. Clear all cookies (DevTools → Application → Clear site data)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Check dev server is running
4. Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: Login works but doesn't redirect**
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console - does it show "🚀 Redirecting now..."?
2. Try the test page: http://localhost:3000/test-auth
3. Check if JavaScript is enabled
4. Try a different browser

### **Issue: Redirects but then kicks me out**
**Solutions:**
1. Check cookie is being set (DevTools → Application → Cookies)
2. Check cookie has `auth_token` name
3. Check `/api/auth/me` endpoint returns user data
4. Try clearing cookies and logging in fresh

### **Issue: Can't see auth_token cookie**
**Solutions:**
1. HTTP-only cookies won't show in `document.cookie`
2. Check DevTools → Application → Cookies instead
3. Verify `credentials: 'include'` is in fetch calls
4. Check server is setting cookie correctly

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **Regular User Login Flow:**
1. User enters credentials on `/auth`
2. Click "Sign In"
3. See "Login successful! Redirecting..." message
4. Automatically redirect to `/dashboard`
5. Dashboard loads with user data
6. Can navigate to different sections

### **Admin Login Flow:**
1. Admin enters credentials on `/auth`
2. Click "Sign In"
3. See "Login successful! Redirecting..." message
4. Automatically redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
5. Admin dashboard loads with admin controls
6. Can manage users, settings, etc.

## 📊 **System Check**

Run this quick check to verify everything:

```bash
# 1. Server is running
# Should see: ▲ Next.js 14.1.0 (turbo) - Local: http://localhost:3000

# 2. Database is connected
# Try test auth page: http://localhost:3000/test-auth

# 3. Can create new user
# Go to auth page, switch to signup, create test account

# 4. New user can login
# Login with the account you just created
```

---

## ✅ **Success!**

If you can:
- ✅ Login successfully
- ✅ See success message
- ✅ Automatically redirect to dashboard
- ✅ Stay logged in after page refresh
- ✅ Access protected routes
- ✅ Logout and get redirected to auth

**Then your login system is working perfectly!** 🎉

## 🆘 **Need More Help?**

If issues persist:

1. **Check server logs** - Look at terminal where `npm run dev` is running
2. **Check browser console** - F12 → Console tab for errors
3. **Use test page** - http://localhost:3000/test-auth for debugging
4. **Check database** - Verify users exist in database
5. **Try different browser** - Rule out browser-specific issues
