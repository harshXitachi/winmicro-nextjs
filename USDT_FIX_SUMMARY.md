# USDT TRC20 Integration - Fix Applied ✅

## Issue
The error **"USDT deposits not yet supported"** was appearing when trying to deposit USDT.

## Root Cause
The `WalletSection.tsx` component had a hardcoded error message instead of implementing USDT deposit functionality.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `WalletSection.tsx`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded error message
- ✅ Added USDT deposit flow using CoinPayments API
- ✅ Implemented crypto payment modal showing:
  - TRC20 deposit address
  - QR code for easy scanning

  - Required confirmations info

### 2. Database Verified
- ✅ `usdt_wallet_enabled: true` confirmed in commission_settings
- ✅ USDT admin wallet exists with 0.00 balance

  - Max deposit: 5000.00 USDT
  - Min withdrawal: 10.00 USDT
  - Max withdrawal: 2000.00 USDT

### 3. Migration Created
- ✅ `003_enable_usdt_wallet.sql` migration added
- ✅ Ensures USDT wallet is always enabled
