# AWS Amplify Deployment - Next Steps

Your Next.js app has been successfully built and configured for AWS Amplify Gen 2!

## ✅ Build Status
- Build completed successfully 
- All TypeScript errors fixed
- Ready for deployment

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Git-Based Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for AWS Amplify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to AWS Amplify Console → App settings
3. Click "Connect repository" (if not already done)
4. Select your Git provider and repository
5. Amplify will automatically deploy on every push

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Console
1. Go to AWS Amplify Console → microwin app
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Deploy without Git"
4. Upload your `.next` build folder as a ZIP file
5. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 3: AWS Amplify CLI (Advanced)
```bash
npx ampx sandbox --once   # Deploy backend
npm run build             # Build frontend
npx amplify deploy        # Deploy hosting
```

## Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in AWS Amplify Console:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Any other variables from `.env.local`

## Build Configuration
Your app is configured with:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `.next`
- Framework: Next.js 14

## Domain & SSL
- Amplify provides a free `.amplifyapp.com` domain
- Free SSL certificate included
- Custom domain support available

## Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Amplify Console
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure `npm run build` passes locally
4. Check node version requirements
